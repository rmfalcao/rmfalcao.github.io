# Researcher on Software Engineering at Fraunhofer IESE, Lecturer of Software Architecture at Mannheim Technical University of Applied Sciences

I am a computer scientist who worked in industry for 15 years as a project manager, project leader, and software engineer, with experience in many domains but particularly in mobile telecommunications (Operation Support Systems and Business Support Systems). I began researching context awareness in 2012, and in 2015, I started my PhD on the topic. I completed my PhD in 2022 at the University of Kaiserslautern (Germany). My thesis, titled "Data-driven Context Modeling for the Elicitation of Context-aware Functionalities," is available for download [here](https://publica.fraunhofer.de/bitstreams/7593ac9b-ade9-4871-8ac1-718995669a45/download).

I have contributed as a reviewer/PC member in journals, conferences, and workshops, including JSS, SQJ, JSME, ICSA, REFSQ, RCIS, CIbSE, SBSC, and CREARE. I am one of the co-organizers of [SAGAI](https://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/en/events/sagai.html).

I am currently a researcher, senior software architect, and project manager at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering (IESE)](https://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/) (Germany), where I lead the topic **Generative AI and Sofware Architecture**. Besides that, I lecture Software Architecture at [Mannheim Technical University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-mannheim.de/).
