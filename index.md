title: About me
---

I am a software engineer who has been working in industry for 15 years as a project manager, project leader, systems analyst, and programmer, with experience in many domains but particularly in mobile telecommunications (Operation Support Systems and Business Support Systems). In 2012, I started to do research on context awareness, which became my PhD topic, completed in 2022 at the University of Kaiserslautern (Germany).

Currently I am researcher, senior software architect, and project manager at the Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering IESE (Germany). And I am passionate about the idea of working on bridging the gap between industry and academia. My list of research interests includes experimental software engineering, data-driven context modeling, context models, interoperability, and data privacy.
